# Informative Path Planning: Exploring Performance of Robots for Science Missions

In this repository there are a number of tutorials which walk through the development of a simulated environment that a simulated robot can explore-exploit using classical informative path planning (IPP) frameworks.

In **ipp.ipynb** you can find the majority of our implementation.

Please note that the basis of most of this code is derived from the following papers:
* [No-Regret Replanning under Uncertainty - Sun et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05162.pdf)
* [Gaussian Process Optimization in the Bandit Setting: No Regret and Experimental Design - rinivas et al. 2010](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05162.pdf)
* [Multi-Modal Active Perception for Information Gathering in Science Missions - Arora et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09716.pdf)
